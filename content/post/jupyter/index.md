### Overview
The household registration system is a household-based population management system implemented for national citizens settled in mainland China, which divides household attributes into agricultural and non-agricultural households based on geographical and family member relationships, indicating the legitimacy of natural persons living in the local area. This dualistic urban-rural household registration system inhibits the free movement of people between urban and rural areas and is discriminatory in terms of social welfare. Although the division between agricultural and non-agricultural hukou has been phased out of the hukou management system since 2014, it still has widespread and far-reaching effects. Our working paper empirically investigates the social integration of China's mobile population based on the above background.

### Searching for the instrumental variable of household registration - and discussing the impact of the household registration system on the social integration of migrant population
Household registration is common as an explanatory variable in empirical evidence due to the specificity of China's dualistic household registration system and the differences in the rights and benefits attached to it. In the policy context of family planning, this paper proposes to use family size and number of children as instrumental variables of household registration, and discusses its relevance and exogeneity qualitatively and verifies it statistically, while empirically analysing the impact of the household registration system on the citizenship of the migrant population. After controlling for city, individual control variables and fixed effects, the following conclusions are drawn: family size and number of children pass the over-identification test when used as instrumental variables for household registration; non-agricultural households have about 20.2% lower settlement intentions and 7.28% lower employment levels in inflow cities compared to the agricultural household group; the mechanism of the effect of the nature of household registration on employment still holds for the non-migrante population group.

### Housing Property and Social Integration of the Migrant Population: Analysis based on China Migrants Dynamic Survey 2018
Using China Migrants Dynamic Survey 2018 and designing the research framework based on push-pull theory, this study empirically analyzes the impact of urban and rural residential property rights factors on the social integration of the migrant population. The results show that there is a significant negative relationship between the ownership of rural residential property rights (residential bases) of the migrant population on their social integration in the inflowing cities. The higher the house price of the migrant population in the inflow city, the lower the level of their social integration. Meanwhile, there is a nonlinear hypothesis for the effect of house price on the social integration of the migrant population.
