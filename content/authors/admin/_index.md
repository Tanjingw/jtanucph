I am a postgraduate student at University of Copenhagen and my main research is on labour and development economics combining reduced and structural form. Specifically, my most recent research is based on a dynamic spatial structure theory model that investigates the impact of urban characteristics on the social behaviour of mobile populations. Another of my projects is a study of the impact of the Three Gorges Navigation Quasi-Natural Experiment on economic development.
