I am a graduate student at the University of Copenhagen, my main research is development economics and labour economics based on structural form. Specifically, my recent projects are social integration of migrant population using Household Behaviour Structural Model, and the impact of a quasi-natural experiment about inland waterway navigation on economic development using Dynamic Spatial Structural Model.
