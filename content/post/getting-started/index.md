title: The impact of the quasi-natural experiment 'Three Gorges Navigation'
subtitle: The Three Gorges Ship Locks, the largest river navigation project in China, was opened to traffic in 2003. Our team has used DID, RDD and SCM models to analyse the impact of this project on economic development. Working papers based on this quasi-natural experiment have been externally reviewed in several top journals.

summary: The Three Gorges Ship Locks, the largest river navigation project in China, was opened to traffic in 2003. Our team has used DID, RDD and SCM models to analyse the impact of this project on economic development. Working papers based on this quasi-natural experiment have been under reviewed in top field journals.

### Overview
Yangtze River shipping is a transportation artery linking southwest, central and east China and the southeast coastal region of China, and is an important support for the economic development of the regions along the river. The Three Gorges navigation hub is located in an important location along the Yangtze River main line, which is an important channel for logistics through the Yangtze River "Golden Waterway". Every year, a large number of materials and products pass through the Three Gorges hub, circulating between the central, eastern and western regions. The Three Gorges double-lane five-stage locks are currently the world's largest inland locks in terms of the number of consecutive stages, total drop and single stage drop. Our team has written several papers based on this quasi-natural experiment.

### Three Gorges Navigation and Urban Economic Development - A Study Based on DMSP/OLS Satellite Lighting Data
The Three Gorges navigation is of strategic importance in improving the modern transportation network and promoting the flow of resources within the region. This paper explores the economic effects and mechanisms of the Three Gorges permanent locks opening on the Yangtze River basin cities by using quasi-natural experiments and satellite lighting data as a proxy variable for economic level through DID and DDD. The results show that: (1) the economic level of cities increased significantly after the opening of the Three Gorges, with a certain time lag effect; (2) the opening of the Three Gorges promoted the development of the tertiary industry and further optimised the industrial structure; (3) the opening of the Three Gorges significantly boosted the domestic freight capacity, providing strong support for releasing land transport resources and accelerating the flow of resources between regions.

### Three Gorges Navigation and International Trade Development - An Empirical Analysis Based on Dynamic Spatial Structure Model

The research framework of this paper is based on the dynamic spatial structure model established by Desmet (2018). The model combines economic development with spatial geography to examine the impact of population concentration, firm innovation, and infrastructure development conditions on international trade development. The model is based on dynamic systems and offers greater flexibility relative to Allen's (2014) static spatial economic model. In this paper, we extend the model in two ways. Firstly, we add capital as a factor of production to the firm's production function and create an expression that incorporates capital for the firm's profit maximisation problem. Secondly, the paper considers the impact of transport infrastructure development on the trade balance and general equilibrium. In this paper, we select provincial panel data for the 20-year period 1998-2017 and develop a SCM model to analyse the impact of the quasi-natural experiment of the Three Gorges Pass on trade development. We also use prefecture-level city panel data from 2000-2017 to robustly test the findings.

**In addition, our other working papers analyse the impact of the quasi-natural experiment of Three Gorges Navigation using labour endowment allocation, TFP, and GDP as dependent variables.**
