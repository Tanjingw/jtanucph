### Overview
The household registration system is a household-based population management system implemented for national citizens settled in mainland China, which divides household attributes into agricultural and non-agricultural households based on geographical and family member relationships, indicating the legitimacy of natural persons living in the local area. This dualistic urban-rural household registration system inhibits the free movement of people between urban and rural areas and is discriminatory in terms of social welfare. Although the division between agricultural and non-agricultural hukou has been phased out of the hukou management system since 2014, it still has widespread and far-reaching effects. Our working paper empirically investigates the social integration of China's mobile population based on the above background.

### Searching for the instrumental variable of household registration - and discussing the impact of the household registration system on the social integration of migrant population
Household registration is common as an explanatory variable in empirical evidence due to the specificity of China's dualistic household registration system and the differences in the rights and benefits attached to it. In the policy context of family planning, this paper proposes to use family size and number of children as instrumental variables of household registration, and discusses its relevance and exogeneity qualitatively and verifies it statistically, while empirically analysing the impact of the household registration system on the citizenship of the migrant population. After controlling for city, individual control variables and fixed effects, the following conclusions are drawn: family size and number of children pass the over-identification test when used as instrumental variables for household registration; non-agricultural households have about 20.2% lower settlement intentions and 7.28% lower employment levels in inflow cities compared to the agricultural household group; the mechanism of the effect of the nature of household registration on employment still holds for the non-migrante population group.

### Housing Property and Social Integration of the Migrant Population: Analysis based on China Migrants Dynamic Survey 2018
Using China Migrants Dynamic Survey 2018 and designing the research framework based on push-pull theory, this study empirically analyzes the impact of urban and rural residential property rights factors on the social integration of the migrant population. The results show that there is a significant negative relationship between the ownership of rural residential property rights (residential bases) of the migrant population on their social integration in the inflowing cities. The higher the house price of the migrant population in the inflow city, the lower the level of their social integration. Meanwhile, there is a nonlinear hypothesis for the effect of house price on the social integration of the migrant population.

### Does House Price Affect the Fertility Plans of the Migrants? Empirical analysis based on China Migrants Dynamic Survey 2018
This paper uses data from the 2018 China Migrant Dynamic Survey to estimate the impact of house prices on the fertility plans of the migrant population, with the sample consisting of 45,355 married female migrants aged 16-50. The results show that the higher house prices in the inflow cities, the less likelihood female migrants have fertility plans; when the housing pressure of the migrants is low, their fertility plans are less affected by house prices; the sensitivity of the migrant population's fertility plans to house prices is also influenced by the moderating effect of infrastructure development; the fertility plans of female migrants with larger family size, higher education level and younger age are more sensitive to house prices.

### Can Education Motivate Individual Health Demands? Dynamic Pseudo-panel Evidence from China’s Immigration
Enhancing residents’ willingness to participate in basic health services is a key initiative to optimize the allo-cation of health care resources and promote equitable improvements in group health. This paper investigates the effect of education on resident health record completion rates using a system GMM model based on pseudo-panel that consisting of five-year cross-sectional data. To mitigate possible endogeneity, this paper controls for cohort effects while also attenuating dynamic bias in the estimation from a dynamic perspective and provides robust estimates based on multi-model regression. The results show that (1) education can give positive returns on health needs to the mobile population under the static perspective, and such returns are underestimated when cohort effects are ignored; (2) there is a significant cumulative effect of file completion rate under the dynamic perspective, and file completion in previous years will have a positive effect on the current year. (3)The positive relationship between education and willingness to make health decisions is also characterized by heterogeneity by gender, generation, and education level itself. Among them, education is more likely to promote decision-making intentions among men and younger groups, and this motivational effect is more significant among those who received basic education.
