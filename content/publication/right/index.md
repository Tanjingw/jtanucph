abstract: This paper uses China Migrants Dynamic Survey 2017 data and designing the research framework based on push-pull theory, empirically analyzing the impact of urban and rural residential property rights factors on the social integration of the migrant population. The results show that there is a significant negative relationship between the ownership of rural residential property rights (residential bases) of the migrant population on their social integration in the inflowing cities. The higher the house price of the migrant population in the inflow city, the lower the level of their social integration. In addition, there is non-linear relationship between the impact of house price on the social integration of migrant population.
