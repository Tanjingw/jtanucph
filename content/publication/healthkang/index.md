abstract: Enhancing residents’ willingness to participate in basic health services is a key initiative to optimize the allo-cation of health care resources and promote equitable improvements in group health. This paper investigates the effect of education on resident health record completion rates using a system GMM model based on pseudo-panel that consisting of five-year cross-sectional data. To mitigate possible endogeneity, this paper controls for cohort effects while also attenuating dynamic bias in the estimation from a dynamic perspective and provides robust estimates based on multi-model regression. The results show that (1) education can give positive returns on health needs to the mobile population under the static perspective, and such returns are underestimated when cohort effects are ignored; (2) there is a significant cumulative effect of file completion rate under the dynamic perspective, and file completion in previous years will have a positive effect on the current year. (3)The positive relationship between education and willingness to make health decisions is also characterized by heterogeneity by gender, generation, and education level itself. Among them, education is more likely to promote decision-making intentions among men and younger groups, and this motivational effect is more significant among those who received basic education.
